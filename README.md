## Project Context

This app was completed in Week 17 of the Turing program. The purpose of this project was to demonstrate mastery of the following:
- React
- Router
- Asynchronous JavaScript
- End to end testing with Cypress

Requirements for this project included:

- Meeting the specs for an “MVP” listed in the Project Spec
- Using at least one external API
- Implementing one of the “Stretch Technologies” listed in the Project Spec
- The app being deployed

[Project Spec](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-3/showcase.html) | [Project Wireframe](https://www.figma.com/file/tIuRIM9rb6eq8gWRGrhr07/Showcase-Solo-Proj?node-id=0%3A1)

## Dev Notes
### Wins/Successes
- Writing in TypeScript and debugging TypeScript errors
- Implementing App Architecture in the context of React-Router
- Providing Error handling pages that can be routed to
- Refactoring for SRP

### Challenges
- Learning and applying Redux: to finish this project in time, I only applied Redux when checking the status of which manga are bookmarked
- Slugging URL for readability and routing purposes 
- Cypress testing bookmark buttons to check icon src or class
